# Object Measurement and Detection
This project uses OpenCV and YOLOv5 to detect objects in images and measure their dimensions in centimeters. The system excludes human detections and focuses on other objects, labeling each detected object with its name and dimensions.

# Installation
Clone the repository from GitHub and navigate to the project directory.

# Usage
You can use this project in two modes:
1- Processing a Static Image: Detect objects in a static image and measure their dimensions.
2- Real-Time Detection Using Webcam: Detect objects in real-time using a webcam.

# Configuration
1- Reference Object To measure object dimensions accurately, a known reference object is required for calibration. You need to update the script with the dimensions and bounding box coordinates of your reference object.

# Display Settings
The display window size can be adjusted by changing the scaling percentage in the script to make the visualization larger or smaller as needed.
